        <p>These applications have been evolved during my professionnalisation contract for my last year of studies.<br/>
        The objective was they pass from VB.Net to C#.Net, with a better design, intuitive use.</p>

        <p>During my experience as a benchmark engineer, i wanted to create a game in C++ to feel back the sensation of programming <br/>
        I started the development of the engine, collisions, some animations and moving. I gave up because I recognized I was too much ambitious and this require a lot of time to start from scratch. <br/>
        But I still have some pieces of my work.</p>

        <h1>Warhammer 2nd edition fantasy roleplay utility application</h1>
        <h2>Personnal</h2>
        <img src="images/acacia.png" alt="a slot"/>
        <p>When I was playing a lot of the roleplaying game Warhammer 2nd edition fantasy roleplay, I wanted to develop an application in Java with a MySQL database in order to create non-playable characters fast, save it, re-use it. <br/>
        But I stopped playing it when I start playing the 4th version. Database was putted in place, scripts ready and put in it, a start of conception and interface working.</p>

        <h1>Hanoï Tower Game</h1>
        <h2>For Interview</h2>
        <img src="images/acacia.png" alt="a slot"/>
        <p>When I wanted to gain a mission as a QML developer (C++ in back, javascript in front), I got challenged on my skills in face of a situation where I don't know the technology at all. The developer put some challenges and conditions to build this Hanoï Tower Game. <br/>
        Main challenge was a game working, with a timer, counting the time with 4 disks. There were other optionals steps. Without help except myself, looking on internet, the result was the game was completed, up to 8 disks, drag'n'drop working, challenge mode, a menu, animations when winning. <br/>
        One of my projects I'm proud and is a proof I can learn and realize good things when I don't know anything.</p>
        <h3>Statement : Completed.</h3>

        <h1>Werewolves of Miller's Hollow utilities application from One Night/One Crepuscule</h1>
        <h2>Personnal</h2>
        <img src="images/acacia.png" alt="a slot"/>
        <p>Back in France, I was going to a board game bar where I played a lot the game of werewolves of Miller's Hollow. Since we were creating a lot of roles to match the game of Miller's Hollow (basic game), we had some hard time to remember. <br/>
        In order to improve my skills and learn a new technology, I created the application on Angular that allow to track the calls, roles alive, register informations like the lovers. Then, from a web application, this was deported to a mobile one through the 'capacitor' module that transforms angular application into mobile application.</p>
        <h3>Statement : Completed.</h3>

        <h1>Werewolves of Miller's Hollow utilities application</h1>
        <h2>Personnal</h2>
        <img src="images/acacia.png" alt="a slot"/>
        <p>I did it again but from scratch in Kotlin this time, to learn new things and do better. This one was needed for my work as a free animator in a board game association I was going a lot and where I bring the culture of roleplaying. Since the host were giving me their full trust, and we were, with friends, handling with paper before a lot of informations, <br/>
        I decided to create again this application, but with the the cards of the original game, changing his aspect, handling better and logical turn and calls, informations, adding a creation role part in it. This application is another one I'm proud of. It is light in memory, fast, intuitive.</p>

        <p>He he... who said you can't put your own portfolio that display this into your personal projects? Isn't it true? This portfolio is realized in React, again another pretext to learn new technologies! This portfolio will always be under evolution, maybe it will have a final state one day!</p>
